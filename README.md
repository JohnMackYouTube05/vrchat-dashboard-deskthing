## Usage
In order for this program to work, you'll need to put your VRChat Login information into the settings page. Username, password, and two-step verification code. After saving them, and clicking the button on the page to request your friends list, the program should log into VRChat's API, download all the necessary resources, and send them straight to the Car Thing. 
**Do note that this program is limited to loading in the information of a maximum of 50 friends at once, to help save on the Car Thing's limited RAM.**

## Bug Reports
If you have issues with this program at any time, don't be afraid to open an issue, and I'll see what I can do to fix things up. This is still a work in progress! I'm still working out a few things with the user interface.
